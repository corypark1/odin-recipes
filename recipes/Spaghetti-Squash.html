    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>paghetti squash with vegetables, feta cheese, and olives makes a surprisingly tasty side dish or vegetarian meal. The roasted flesh of spaghetti squash comes out in long strands, very much resembling the noodles for which it is named. You can substitute different vegetables here, but be sure to use ones that have contrasting colors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <li>1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>¾ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sliced black olives</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven: </strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Place spaghetti squash cut-sides down on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until a sharp knife can be inserted with only a little resistance, about 30 minutes. Remove squash from oven and set aside to cool enough to be easily handled.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook: </strong>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in oil until tender. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are warmed through.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop: </strong>Use a large spoon to scoop the stringy pulp from the squash and place in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix: </strong>Toss with cooked onion-tomato mixture, feta cheese, olives, and basil.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
