   <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
   <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
   <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
   <li>1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
   <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
   <li>2 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
   <li>12 dry lasagna noodles</li>
   <li>1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
   <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
   <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare Meat Sauce: </strong>Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes; drain fat. Mix in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and oregano. Simmer meat sauce, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat Oven: </strong>Set oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Noodles: </strong>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Lay noodles flat on towels; blot dry.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix ricotta Cheese: </strong>Mix together ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer Lasagna: </strong>Layer 1/3 of the noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Cover the ricotta mixture with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 of the meat sauce. Repeat. Top with remaining noodles and meat sauce. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool: </strong>Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
